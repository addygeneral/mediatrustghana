									<h2>Local Language Media Excellence Project</h2>
									<p>A majority of Ghanaians, both literate and illiterate prefer to consume radio and television programmes in Ghanaian languages,
										 predominantly Twi. This makes local language media, hugely influential in the dissemination of information and the shaping of public opinion.
										  Unfortunately, many practitioners in the sector are poorly trained and seem to have developed their own set of journalistic mores, often characterized by extreme exaggeration and the blurring of lines between straightforward reporting and editorials.
										   The objective of this project is to train and retrain practitioners in best journalistic practice, whiles preserving and enhancing the cultural values that make them the media of choice for millions of Ghanaians. 
										   It is expected that the project will see a significant and visible improvement in standards, as well as increased professional prestige for practitioners. In partnership with our partners, we hope to develop new guidelines for local language radio that are acceptable to all stakeholders.
										    We will also institute an awards scheme for that category of radio.</p>
